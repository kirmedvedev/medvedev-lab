I am Barsha Roy, currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida and a member of the Medvedev Lab. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET) in Bangladesh. My research focuses on the intersection of cancer bioinformatics and structural biology. I am interested in exploring computational frameworks to understand genomic complexity and in developing efficient algorithms that can translate large-scale biological data into meaningful clinical insights. In my free time, I enjoy trekking, exploring different places, and watching movies
