Assistant Professor @ University of Central Florida <br>
Deparatment of Computer Science <br>

I grew up in Akademgorodok (also known as “Academic Town”), a scientific center in Siberia, Russia, home to 35 research institutes. I was always facinated by scientific environment around me and earned Masters degree in Bioinformatics from Novosibirsk State University in 2010 and PhD in Mathematical Biology and Bioinformaics from Institute of Cytology and Genetics (Novosibirsk, Russia) in 2015.

In 2016 I started my postdoctoral research at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX) with Professor Nick Grishin. In August 2025, Medvedev Lab officially opened at the University of Central Florida.
