Assistant Professor @ University of Central Florida <br>
Deparatment of Computer Science <br>

I grew up in [Akademgorodok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademgorodok), a unique scientific hub in Siberia established in the late 1950s. It was envisioned by some as a kind of “New Atlantis” for science – imagine a town built right in the pine forest, home to more than 65,000 scientists who worked at 35 research institutes dedicated to molecular biology, chemistry, physics and cybernetics. Our neighbors were families of scientists and engineers, often engaged in discussions about the latest scientific news, and the local cafés and courtyards echoed with debates on a wide range of scientific topics. This environment definitely sparked my early curiosity, leading me to a Masters in Bioinformatics from Novosibirsk State University (2010) and a PhD in Mathematical Biology and Bioinformatics from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics (2015). <br>

This early fascination with discovery took me to Dallas, Texas, in 2016 to join the lab of Professor [Nick Grishin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ok6uF9kAAAAJ) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center – a true luminary in the field of computational structural biology. UTSW itself is a powerhouse, home to numerous [Nobel laureates](https://utswmed.org/why-utsw/legacy-research-discovery/nobel-prizes/) and renowned for its groundbreaking research across various biomedical disciplines. <br>

In August 2025, Medvedev Lab officially opened at the University of Central Florida, joining a university that has rapidly become a hub for innovation and technology in Central Florida, even boasting its own research park that fosters collaboration with [industry](https://incubator.ucf.edu/clients-central-florida/) and NASA – a partnership befitting "[America's Space University](https://www.ucf.edu/space/)." Notably, UCF ranks among the top five most innovative public universities in the nation, making it a prime environment for groundbreaking research. <br>
