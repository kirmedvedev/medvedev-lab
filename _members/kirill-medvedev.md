Assistant Professor @ University of Central Florida <br>
Deparatment of Computer Science <br>

Growing up in [Akademgorodok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademgorodok), a unique scientific hub in Siberia established in the late 1950s, was quite something. It was envisioned by some as a kind of "New Atlantis" for science – imagine a town built right in the pine forest, home to 35 research institutes where even then, open discussions about things like genetics – which weren't always easy to talk about elsewhere – thrived. This environment definitely sparked my early curiosity, leading me to a Masters in Bioinformatics from Novosibirsk State University (2010) and a PhD in Mathematical Biology and Bioinformatics from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics (2015) – the same place that famously domesticated foxes surprisingly quickly!<br>

This early fascination with discovery took me to Dallas, Texas, in 2016 to join the lab of Professor [Nick Grishin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ok6uF9kAAAAJ) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center – a true luminary in the field of computational structural biology. UTSW itself is a powerhouse, home to numerous Nobel laureates and renowned for its groundbreaking research across various biomedical disciplines. <br>
