Medvedev Lab will open in August 2025 in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/) at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/).

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research employs a **multiscale approach** to develop and apply methods for the classification and analysis of large-scale biomedical datasets. 
</br>
1. At the **molecular level**, we focuse on developing tools and databases to classify and analyze protein domain features and their intercations with small molecules and drugs.
2. At the **cellular level**, we focus on analyzing expression profile variations within cancer types to uncover the factors that lead to diverse clinical outcomes.
3. At the **tissue level** we develope deep learning methods to identify cancer subtypes using tissue histopathology and linking tissue morphology to molecular features to improve diagnosis and treatment selection.
