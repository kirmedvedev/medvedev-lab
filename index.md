Our research employs a **multiscale approach** to develop and apply methods for the classification and analysis of large-scale biomedical datasets. 

1. At the **molecular level**, we focus on developing tools and databases to classify and analyze protein domain features and their interactions with small molecules and drugs.
2. At the **cellular level**, we focus on analyzing expression profile variations within cancer types to uncover the factors that lead to diverse clinical outcomes.
3. At the **tissue level** we develop deep learning methods to identify cancer subtypes using tissue histopathology and linking tissue morphology to molecular features to improve diagnosis and treatment selection.
